      Innovative, hardworking, ambitous and determine are just a few words that describes Dowaine Anderson.
      I am a God fearing man, who likes good food, good association, good music, action movies and motivational
      or self help books. I am interested in creating wealth for myself, my family and the next generations to
      come. I am also interested in travelling the world, owning several different cars, freedom from having to go to
      a job (retiring early), living life on my own terms while positively impacting many lives. I am a big dreamer by
      nature and I
      value working hard but smart. How did I get to where I am now, at this point in my life? You might ask!!! </p>
    <p class="main-paragraph"> Let me tell you a story.</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph"> Long long time ago, around thirty plus years, from humble
      beginings, in a small
      community resting deep in the hills of Saint Catherine; a bouncing baby boy was given birth to in Kingston and
      was raised
      in Saint Catherine.
      As a child growing up, he was very hardworking. This began at home, as he would willing take part in chores,
      tend to the farm, among any other tasks that were given to him. He diligently did all his duties without
      complaining,
      thus gaining the appreciation for work in general and it also thought him core values which helped him throughout
      his life.
      Having gained that experience and appreciation from home; it translated throughout his childhood, especially his
      church and school life.</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph">At school; he participated in tending to the school farm where they had their own live
      stock (cattle and chicken).
      At church, it was no
      different; he participated in numerous activites and one of those activities was playing music (today he is a
      skilled drummer).
      Growing up without a father wasn't a big deal, until he went to high school. This realization, took it's toll
      right
      through out
      the latter part of high school. This lad was however a good behaving child and very quiet, despite not having a
      father figure in his life. As he went on
      with his life and upon leaving high school, he was not at the legal age to get a job. So he repeated grade ten at
      another high school.</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph">At the second high school, this young lad joined the track and field team, to get a free
      pass to
      attend the school inorder to relieve his mother from paying the school fee. When the final year came, he got his
      first
      job as a pump attendant
      at Bourne's Texaco Service Station. With a mindset of wanting more out of life, he never stayed there long. He
      then
      went to further his education, at
      the Caribbean Maritime Institute (currently known as Caribbean Maritime University) to make himself more
      marketable
      for the working world.
      Growing up for this lad wasn't easy, niether was adulthood; his second job pushed him to be more responsible as he
      starts to see the
      bigger picture and perspectives changed. As this lad continues to grow personally and mentally, it spur something
      within him; he started
      to become more business minded, and as a result, his mindset, values and interests starts to gravitate towards
      that angle.
    <p class="main-paragraph">This gravitational pull, caused him to start venture
      down the entrepernurial road. He is now the founder and CEO of Safe Journey Car Rental Services, chief musician
      at
      his church, just to mention a few achievements attained; after having gone through faliure, after failure,
      after failure. He is also looking to open other doors to achieving his dreams which is to build a legacy for
      generations to come, because he never stop trying and now you are reading
      just a small part of his story, that lad name is Dowaine Anderson.</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph">I am currently writting a blog about wealth and
      attached
      below is the 'about us' page for my blog;
      titled: Wealth Toll Booth.

      In life, there are two categories of people;
    <ol class="main-paragraph">
      <li>The 1% category (the wealthy)</li>
      <li>The 99% (the poor and
        middle class)</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="main-paragraph"> These will be broken down for you later. It was mentioned in the book, Cash Flow
      Quadrant, written by
      Robert
      Kiyosaki that these two main categories, attracts a certain mindset. But as time changes, more and more
      persons
      in the
      99% category are making or looking to make that mindset shift. Therefore, they are seeking creative
      ways
      to
      build their wealth in order to become apart of the 1% category.</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph">Wealth Toll Booth (WTB) is a mentorship
      club,
      created to mentor and educate those persons on how to build long-lasting personal and generational
      wealth by
      switching and adopting the 1% mindset, and strategically place 'toll booth(s)' on the 'rodways' of their
      life, where 'financial traffic' normally flows. Hence; WTB mentorship club will help bridge the gap, by
      building
      a community where applied knowledge about wealth creation can be shared and in the long run,
      applied by those needing to advance themselves; but in order to do that, WTB will break down certain
      phrases
      that was used, as to give you a clear brief understanding and out look.</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph">A 'toll booth' in this context; is symbolic to the the areas in everyday life that manages
      and directs
      'financial traffic', such as; investments, afiliate marketing, business ownership, e.t.c.
      A toll booth in the real world, manages and directs the movement of vehicular traffic. Let's now look at
      'roadway'; a 'roadway' in this context, is symbolic to the areas in life that is intended for 'fincial
      traffic'
      such as;
      income generating avenues. A roadway in general is only that portion of a road, intended for normal
      vehicular
      traffic. 'Financial traffic', as it is coined in this context, is symbolic to the areas in life that
      measures
      the inward and
      outward cash flow. Whenever the inward cash flow outweighs the outward cash flow, there is a build up of
      finances, causing 'financial traffic' and these measures would include having more than one income
      streams.</p>
