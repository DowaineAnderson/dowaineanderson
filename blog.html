                <li class="sub">How to build a Wealth Toll Booth</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is the Definition of Wealth?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">First, let's look at the components that make up wealth.</p>
            <ol class="sub">
                <li class="sub">Healthy Cash Flow</li>
                <li class="sub">Healthy Lifestyle</li>
                <li class="sub">Entrepernurial Mindset</li>
            </ol>
            <p class=main-paragraph>
                There are many definitions for wealth, but let's really look at what it means to be wealthy. Base on
                my
                observation and understanding,
                wealth is not measured in cash; because, by itself is a bi-product and not a component. Cash only
                defines
                riches, so does possessing
                things.
            <p class="main-paragraph">So what is my definition? You might ask. Wealth or true wealth, in my eyes; is
                a balance
                between
                having a healthy cash flow,
                living a healthy lifestyle and having a entrepernurial mindset. Having a healthy cash flow means to
                have
                a
                greater flow of cash coming
                in than going out. It also means that you are no longer a slave to money, and you are making wiser
                financial
                decisions.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">When I say lifestyle,
                I'm talking about; living life the way you want to live it, do whatever you want to do, whenever you
                want do it,
                with
                whomever you want to do it with. Without this component;
                one will just be rich, having loads of money and assests and still feel unacomplished, miserable and
                lonely.
                Why? Because, there will be
                no one to share your success with, people need other people and that's just it.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">The third component
                is
                like
                the engine to a car. A car is just a shell with shiny rims
                and looking beautiful on the outside, but can't go nowhere without a engine. It is the same with
                having wealth without a entrepernurial
                mindset.
                This key component is what seperates
                the men from the boys, it works without been seen, while the outside is shiny and beautiful and
                everyone
                can
                see
                the results; the engine is doing
                all the dirty work, same it is for the entrepernurial mindset.
            </p>
            <h3>Why is the Wealthy in the 1% and the Poor and the Middle Class in the 99%?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                First, let's define what I mean by 1% and 99%. In a section in his book, Cash Flow Quadrant, Robert
                Kiyosaki
                wrote about where do you live.
                He illustrates that through a quadrant, which was labeled; 'E'.'B'.'S'.'I', with 'E' meaning
                employed,
                'B'
                meaning business owner,
                'S' meaning self employed and 'I' meaning investor. All representing a address, do you know where
                you
                live?</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">However; he was saying
                that on the left side, resides the 'E' and the 'S' population which is 99% of the world's population
                and
                they earn 2% of the
                world's dollar. Over on the right side, resides the 'B' and the "I" population which is 1% of
                world's
                population and they earn 98% of the
                world's dollar.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Now that we are on the same page, let's figure out together why this is so.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Robert
                Kiyosaki
                said that; "The main reason why people
                struggle finacially is because they have spent years in school, but learn nothing about money. The
                result is
                that people learn to work for money.....but
                never have money worked for them."
                Look at the diagram below:</p>
            <div id="image-2">
                <img class="diagram-1" src="imgs/card-img-nine.jpeg" alt="image">
            </div>
            <p class="main-paragraph">There are two kinds of people within the business world:
            <ol class="sub">
                <li>Prosumer</li>
                <li>Consumer</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">A Prosumer is typically a producer and a consumer, this person develops
                and
                maintain a healthy
                cash
                flow
                by keeping his or her incoming
                cash flow greater than his or her outgoing cashflow. Meaning that they invest more and splurge
                less,
                they also have the entrepernurial
                mindset to keep producing.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">A consumer on the other hand, does the opposite. Their outgoing cash flow out
                weighs their incoming cash flow.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Now you see that a 1 percenter will always be a 1 percenter, but the good news
                is; a 99
                percenter
                can
                also become a 1 percenter. All it takes is
                a change of mindset and perspective, then everything else wil fall into place. Let's change that
                address
                from
                'E'
                and
                'S' to 'B' and 'I'.</p>

            <h3>Why Do Some Persons Get Wealthy While Others Don't?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                The previous answer touched on this a bit, but let us shed some more light on it.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">It is
                so
                evident that the mindset of the wealthy plays a great role
                in the life of the wealthy and the mindset of the poor and middle class is a huge down fall in the
                life
                of the poor and the middle class. Why do I say that?</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Look
                at
                the memory gem; "The Heights by Great Men".
                It is a primary example of mindset working for one and working against the other."The heights by
                great
                men reach and kept, were not
                attained by sudden flight, but they while their companion slept, were toiling upwards through
                the
                night." I need not to go further
                on this, but this is the reason among other minor matters, is why I believe, some persons get
                wealthy
                while others do not.</p>
            <h3>Is it Difficult to Become Wealthy?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I would say it depends on the individual and their attributes. Their level of endurance, their
                never
                quit attitude, never give up mentality, their ability to go above and beyond, the
                size of their dreams and visions and finally the will power to go against all odds.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">With these
                attributes, the road to becoming wealthy is very much possible despite the difficulties that may
                arise.
            </p>
            <h3>What Defines or Measures When One is Wealthy?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Many would say, having millions in the bank, big house or houses, several cars and the list goes
                on.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">I would say, a equally balanced life
                which is to be: wealthy in family, friends, personal development, having a value
                system, wealthy in assests, time and finances; are the definitions or measurments of one's wealth.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Do I Want to Become Wealthy?</h3>
            <p class=" main-paragraph">
                For me, money is always a bi-product, so my reason isn't money.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Why is that so? To be honest I'm
                not
                motivated by money, but by the options
                it gives me. So that is out the window.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">The number one reason for me is time. Time is spelled L.O.V.E by your
                loved ones,
                it is more
                valuable
                than
                money.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">If you loose one million dollar today;
                you can always get it back, but when time is lost, you can never get it back.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">A good balance
                of
                time, family and freedom are the reasons I want to get wealthy. <br>
                Do you know why you want to become Wealthy?</p>
            <h3>How Can I Become Wealthy?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Let us look into a couple pointers and see:
            <ul class="sub">
                <li class="sub">Awareness</li>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Knowing where you are, is a great assest.</p>
                <li class="sub">Power of Association</li>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Who you associate with, detremines your rise or fall.</p>
                <li class="sub">More than one income streams</li>
                </p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">It is more profitable to have more than one income streams because you
                    will be
                    able to do more
                    financially.</p>
                <li class="sub">Mentorship</li>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Similar to association, one must have one or two persons with the
                    fruit on
                    the tree, to guide
                    them.
                </p>
                <li class="sub">Entrepernurial Spirit</li>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Just like the mindset, this defines the inner core of the human
                    being; which is more like
                    the
                    oil
                    in the engine.</p>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Wealth Creation</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Wealth creation is not a secret; in fact, it is there for everyone. But unfortunately,the majority
                dosen't
                see
                it that way, due to the lack of equipping and passing down of knowledge.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">What seperates the
                wealthy
                and the poor, shockingly isn't
                having more finances or assets; it's simply a different mindset, and that's how the poor remains
                poor
                and
                the wealthy gets wealthier.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Inorder to cash in on the wealth that is circulating within the 1% category,
                first, we must learn
                the
                language of the wealthy.</p>
            <p class=main-paragraph>The language of the wealthy, is not complicated, but it requires you to get
                comfortable with being
                uncomfortable, it requires you
                to come out of your comfort zone, it requires you to not only think outside the box; but get out of
                the
                box and it requires you to
                out
                grow
                yourself personally,
                before you grow financially.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Another interesting fact; the power of association, is also vital. Who
                you
                hang
                around, will determine
                your outcome, you become like the persons you hang around. For example; if you hang around nine
                broke
                people, automatically you will
                become number ten, for that's how the power of association works.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Wealth Toll Booth?</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I've coined this word specifically for this blog. My definition is; building a platform or gateway
                where you can better
                manage
                and
                control your finances, through
                a specific channel. Where you can have a orderly cash flow and accountability. For example:
                investments,
                affiliate marketing and business ownership e.t.c.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Simply put, tell your money where it should go, so you can be more accountable
                and
                incharge, instead
                of
                your
                money telling you where it wants to go. Putting the money incharge and you unaccountable.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">This is
                what
                the
                wealthy
                does; they build pipelines and toll booths.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">For now we want to talk about building a toll booth.</p>
            <h3>How to Build a Wealth Toll Booth</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Assuming you now understand what is a wealth toll booth; let's dive into how we can build one.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">There are
                several
                different platforms to choose from,
                but let's first look into the main characteristics or components that is used to build a wealth toll
                booth.
            <ul class="sub">
                <li class="sub">Leverage

                        THAT'S IT! Building a wealth toll booth is
                        as
                        simple as that, all we need to do is, start
                        telling our money where it must go.
                        <br>
                        A toll booth is very vital, because; in the case of having more
                        than
                        one
                        income streams, and not having the toll booth; you can still be
                        broke, because there will be no leverage, control and DRIP to safegaurd you.
                        <br>
                        So having that platform is
                        where you can better control and manage the money coming in and out, therefore one can
                        avoid
                        going in debt and not live off a single
                        income, without worrying about the account balance in the bank or in most cases; barely getting
                        through the
                        month,
                        immediately after pay day.
                        <br>
                        I have mentioned
                        earlier about investments, affiliate marketing and business ownership, just to name a few; are
                        some
                        prime examples of a wealth toll booth
                        which is used by the wealthy and so can you.
                        <br>
                        Just open up your minds eye and get creative, it's not
                        hard.
                        <br>
                        The lesson is:
                        <br>
                        Only use your job income
                        for basic living, then look for ways to earn a second or even a third income, give yourself
                        leverage.
                        When you start earning
                        that
                        second or third income [this is where
                        it becomes tricky]; the mindset of the poor is to upgrade their lifestyle and spending, but I
                        say
                        remain
                        discipline!!!! Continue living below or within
                        your means, practice DELAYED GRATIFICATION, put off the good for the greater, pay now and play
                        later,
                        are some of the mindsets
                        of the wealthy to adopt.
                        So continue to live from the earnings of your job, while you allow the
                        other
                        two
                        extra
                        incomes to grow, giving you control.
                        <br>
                        Practice DRIP and within one year
                        you will be surprise to see how the wealth toll booth has worked wonders in your life.
                        <br>
                        I've seen
                        first
                        hand,
                        that the wealth toll booth worked for lots of
                        self-made multi-millionares and billionaires, I'm fortunate to have been friends with some, some
                        I've
                        met
                        over the years of doing business and some
                        some I've been mentored by; personally and through books that I've read.
                        <br>
                        If you are employed, living from pay check to pay check and fighting to
